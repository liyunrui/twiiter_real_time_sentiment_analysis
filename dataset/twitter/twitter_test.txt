bombshell from bill taylor: while he visited the front, one of his staffers accompanied ambassador sondland to a meeting with zelensky aide yermak on july 26, the day after the trump/zelensky phone call. after the meeting, at a restaurant, sondland called president trump... 1/

if you’re talking about dan goldman, he worked for doj, which is not the same as working for you. people at doj work for the people & the rule of law. the fact that you don’t know that is exactly one of the reasons why you should be impeached ⁦@realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/3o2etbqxth

new hampshire voter today: “ok joe, i get you hate trump. but why should i vote for you?”  me: “because we’ll get rid of trump’s tariffs immediately, we’ll secure our border humanely, we’ll rebuild our infrastructure, and we’ll actually do something about our debt.”  he smiled.

nobody is impeaching @realdonaldtrump. he’s impeaching himself. in fact, i’ll end my primary challenge to trump tomorrow if you can prove to me that @adamschiff or @speakerpelosi or anybody else forced our poor little helpless president to say “hey, do me a favor...”

there are very few times in life when you’re given the opportunity to truly stand on principle, do what’s right, and risk losing everything. for republicans, this is one of those times.

"it was his gains, and clinton’s slippage, among those four key groups [independents, white suburban women, voters with some college, and minority men] that gave him his inside straight in the ec. yet today trump appears weaker with each of those groups.

i’m running against trump in the gop primary. i’d really appreciate you considering making a contribution. i’m a conservative, our politics may be different, but we agree that trump is a threat who must be stopped.  i’m your 1st shot to stop him. thanks. http://joewalsh.org .

turns out trump instructed his staff, "get the emails."   which is the same as telling staff, "go collude."   which is very different than "no collusion."  also: why was this fact omitted or redacted from the mueller report https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/02/politics/mueller-investigation-notes-trump-stolen-emails/index.html …

getting awful hard to keep up with these moving goalposts. here’s the deal: holding hostage us military aid unless a foreign government helps you get re-elected is a corrupt quid pro quo. it’s a criminal quid pro quo. and it’s an impeachable quid pro quo. this isn’t complicated
